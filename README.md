# scikit-activeml Extension for OpenML python

This is a work in progress and not compatible with [openml-python](https://github.com/openml/openml-python), yet.
If you are interested in testing it, use the following [openml-python fork](https://github.com/scikit-activeml/openml-python-OpenMLActiveClassificationTask) which supports OpenMLActiveClassificationTask and try it out on the openml test server (call `openml.config.start_using_configuration_for_example()` after importing openml).
